## Introduction

While completing a FreeCodeCamp course on Solidity, I initially struggled to understand **imports**.  
After some digging, I realized there are mainly **three ways to import in Solidity**:

- Local imports  
- Import through GitHub (works only in Remix)  
- Import in Brownie  

Let‚Äôs walk through each.

## 1. Local Imports

You can import both **local** and **external files** in Solidity.  

For example,

<ImageBlock src="/blogs/imports-in-solidity/1.png" alt="In Same Folder" height ={150}/>
<ImageBlock src="/blogs/imports-in-solidity/2.png" alt="In Different Folder" height ={150}/>


## 2. Import Through Github (Works only in Remix)

There are many other ways to import other than Github in the remix. But I found this one too easy to follow. 
You just need to copy the GitHub URL pointing to the contract and paste it after import. Please find below e.g.
<ImageBlock src="/blogs/imports-in-solidity/3.png" alt="" height ={150}/>

## 3. Import in Brownie
Brownie is a great package for smart contract development. It is a Python-based development and testing framework for smart contracts targeting the <LinkBlock href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.6.0/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#the-ethereum-virtual-machine">Ethereum Virtual Machine</LinkBlock>.

There are two steps to follow

### Adding Dependancy:-
To import a smart contract/source from a package, one needs to declare the dependencies by adding a dependencies field to your project configuration file. Brownie will download that dependency in the .brownie\packages folder during compilation.

The format to add dependency is **[ORG]/[REPO]@[VERSION].**

For e.g. let‚Äôs import a smart contract from chainlink Github repo. To do so, we need to define dependency in the config file.
<ImageBlock src="/blogs/imports-in-solidity/4.png" alt="dependancies" height ={150}/>

One thing to remember is that the repo must-have release version and tag associated with it. When you execute the brownie compile, the brownie will download the package in the below location on your windows machine.

### Path Remappings:-

Now we need to do path remappings. Brownie exposes this functionality via the compiler.solc.remappings field in the configuration file. Each value under remappings is a string in the format prefix=path

In simple words, it tells brownie to search for a given prefix at a specific path. For e.g.

<ImageBlock src="/blogs/imports-in-solidity/5.png" alt=""/>

Whenever, there is @chainlink occurs in import, it will tell brownie that is refers to smartcontractkit/chainlink@1.3.0

<CodeBlock language="solidity" code={`
import '@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol';

import 'smartcontractkit/chainlink@1.3.0/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol';
`} />

above import‚Äôs refer to the same thing.
