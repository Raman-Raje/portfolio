## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming industries, from autonomous vehicles to personalized streaming.  
But behind the scenes, **AI compilers** are the unsung heroes making these models run faster and smarter on diverse hardware.  

Whether youâ€™re deploying a large language model on a GPU or optimizing a neural network for an edge device,  
AI compilers bridge the gap between high-level models and hardware-specific performance.  

In this blog, weâ€™ll explore the exciting world of AI compilers, from NVIDIA TensorRT to OpenAI Triton. ðŸš€

## What Are AI Compilers?

AI compilers take machine learning models â€” built in frameworks like **PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX** â€” and transform them into optimised, hardware-specific code.  

They act like **translators**: turning abstract algorithms into instructions your GPU, CPU, or specialised accelerator can execute efficiently.  

They employ techniques such as:

- Quantisation  
- Kernel fusion  
- Graph optimisation  

â€¦ all to reduce latency and increase throughput for real-time AI applications.
